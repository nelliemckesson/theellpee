# The LP

Map subway routes to full albums/playlists.

To do:

* Click routes to leave them highlighted
* Function to do the math on the x and y values (instead of doing the math for each position)
* Fix mouseover events for nodes: currently mouseout nullifies the click event
* Move d3 link to external resource
* Fix svg field sizing etc.
* Better subway line labels? Dynamically added from json?
* Feed json from google spreadsheet directly
* User submitted routes
* Manipulate route data to format as required by app
