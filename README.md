# The LP

Map subway routes to full albums/playlists.

To do:

* Click routes to leave them highlighted - necessary? Text is already sticky...
* Fix tooltip float positioning
* Function to do the math on the x and y values (instead of doing the math for each position)
* Move d3 link to external resource
* Fix svg field sizing etc.
* Better subway line labels? Dynamically added from json?
* Preload json data so the chart doesn't lag when the page loads
* User submitted routes
* Manipulate route data to format as required by app
* Add a way for users to curate the submitted routes (upvotes, etc.)
* Design or something
* Write copy
