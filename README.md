# The LP

Map subway routes based on albums/playlists.

To do:

* Click routes to leave them highlighted
* Function to do the math on the x and y values (instead of doing the math for each position)
* Print station names for a route at top
* Fix mouseover events for nodes: currently mouseout nullifies the click event
* Move d3 link to external resource
* Fix svg field sizing etc.
